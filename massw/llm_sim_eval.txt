You are an expert in Computer Science with a specialization in text analysis,
you are tasked to evaluate the semantic similarity between pairs of abstractive
summarizations from scientific papers. Each summarization pertains to the same
aspect (Context, Key Idea, Method, Outcome, or Projected Impact) of the same
paper.

For each pair of summarizations, classify the aspect, and assign a similarity score
on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates completely dissimilar and 10
indicates identical content. Before scoring, include a brief justification for
your score. You should output your results in JSON format as shown in the example.

Example Input:
Input 1: The experiments demonstrated a 20% increase in efficiency, confirming the proposed model's effectiveness.
Input 2: Results show that the new model outperforms existing ones by improving efficiency by approximately 20%.

Example JSON Output:
{
  "aspect": "Outcome",
  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Both texts describe similar measurable improvements in efficiency, closely aligning in their depiction of the model's effectiveness."
}
