## Instructions
You are an expert in computer science.
Your task is to summarize the following five aspects of the papers given the
definitions below.

## Definitions of Aspects
### Context
- The status quo of related literature or reality which motivated this study.
This could normally be a problem, a research question, or a research gap that
has not been successfully addressed by previous work.
- Anything happened before this study.
### Key Idea
- The main intellectual merit of this paper, often in comparison to the
context. This could normally be a novel idea or solution proposed in this paper
that distinguishes it from what’s already done in literature.
- Proposed in this study.
### Method (Validation Methodology)
- The specific experiment or proof that investigates and validates the key idea.
- CS papers often refer "Method" as algorithm or model, but our definition here is **different**.
- Performed in this study.
### Outcome
- The factual statement about the study output. This could be the experiment
results and any other measurable outcome that has occurred. It marks whether
the key hypothesis is testified or not.
- Produced in this study.
### Future Impact
- The impact of the work on the field explicitly anticipated by the authors,
and potential further research explicitly identified by the author that may improve or
extend this study.

## Notes
- If an aspect is NOT mentioned in the abstract, mark it as “N/A” (not
applicable). DO NOT come up with your own interpretation.
- Each aspect should be summarized in 1-2 sentences in most cases.
- Each aspect should be self-contained and should not contain references
    including other aspects (cross-reference).
- Including specific names of proposed models, datasets, etc., in the summary is acceptable.
- If the problem definition is novel (e.g., proposing a new task), classify it as a Key Idea.
- Non-measurable outcomes should be categorized as Future Impact.
- Impacts that have already occurred should be considered as Outcome.
- A new observation that motivates the proposal of a key idea should be classified under Key Idea.
- Future Impact should not account for real impacts, such as the number of
citations a paper has received.

## Response Format
The response should be a JSON object in the following format:
```json
{
    "Context": "...",
    "Key Idea": "...",
    "Method": "...",
    "Outcome": "...",
    "Future Impact": "..."
}
```
